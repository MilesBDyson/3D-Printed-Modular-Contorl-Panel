Summary:
Do you remember them electronic lab kits sold at Radio Shack, 150in1 and it came with big book on how to connect every thing to build different things, the real sneaky part was, that you were learning the entire time. I wonder what would that kit look like today? Picture your favorite development board, Raspberry Pi, Beaglebone, Arduino, mounted in the center of that. what would it look like, what components would it come with today?A customizable control panel kit aimed at mounting all them small sensors, lights, readouts, dials, and switches. This is a must have kit for any development board owner, as your project continues to evolve, so can your panel. Rack um, Stack um, and Pack um. Assembly is simple just need some screws to put it all together, with this method you can easily and quickly disassemble and reassemble your panels as needed, as your project changes, so can the panels.IT'S MODULARThe Basic Set contains solid plates or 'Templates'. designed around a 40x40 grid much like Gridfinity, Covering 1x1 to 4x4 frames and plates that can be modified as you like, mount your small breakout boards on top of them for a nice learning space or below them for sub surface mounting, put holes in them for switches and LED's, Build your project on top of them or use them for controlling it, Whats your ideal control panel look like?No hard to find hardware needed, use M3 pan head wood screws found at any hardware store to secure the plates to the frame, Tile frames to create a more rigid panel where needed. Use long screws on the outer edges of the panel to secure it to a cabinet or wooden bin. This system is quite versatile with seemingly endless possibility in both education and practical usage.The Modular Control Panel Collection:https://www.thingiverse.com/milesdyson/collections/43391187/thingsCheck back often for the latest additions to this collection.Unless Otherwise Specified:Pan Head Wood ScrewM3 x 12mmM3 x 8mmM3 x 6mmMounting Frame:https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7175613WARNINGNever should you try to drill plastic by hand. always take the time to secure the part properly and use caution. I recommend using a large wooden board to screw the plate onto using all holes available to secure the plate in place. &amp; Eye protection!!Actual Hits to this page:
