Modular Control Panel - SH1106-OLED 1x1 by MilesDyson on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7135971

Summary:
nice compact frame for them nice little i2c displays, this is a specialty panel that requires its own frame as the bolt pattern interfiered with the normal one so i had to make some special feet.. dint want to but i did. i will make more for stacking them at some point but for now you can flip and flop that one foot to connect to an existing panel.WARNING!!These little screens are very fragile, its made of glass and even a crack can render them useless... make sure all parts print cleanly and should be a drop in for the pcb when its printed. i spent a lot of time trying to get it right but with the wide tolerance of the different pcb manufactures yours may be tight.. NO! do not press it in .. IF IT DONT DROP IN get a piece of sand paper on a flat surface and file the edges of the pcb only, so it will fit LOOSE .. i did brake one during the process of making this and learned my lesson.. you do not need to over tighten the screws. its only a display not a 5'th wheel trailer hitch.. as long as when you hold all 3 parts together you should still be able to wiggle the pcb so you know your not clamping on that glass screen... i did adjust for better clearance once i discovered this..
